<div align="center"><strong>ðŸš€ Bootstrap your GraphQL server within seconds</strong></div>
<div align="center">Basic starter kit for a flexible GraphQL server for Node.js - based on best practices from the GraphQL community.</div>

## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`apollo-server v2`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server) which is based on new Apollo Server
- **GraphQL database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) (running on MySQL)
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./database/types.graphql) â€“ easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup

You can more learn about the idea behind GraphQL boilerplates [here](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-boilerplates-graphql-create-how-to-setup-a-graphql-project-6428be2f3a5).

## Requirements

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql init`, [Prisma](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma) to deploy and update database use `prisma deploy` and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) to install npm packages:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli prisma yarn
```

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/danilobrinu/prisma-apollo-starter.git

# 2. Navigate to the new project
cd prisma-apollo-starter

# 3. Install npm packages
yarn install

# 4. Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000) and open GraphQL Playground
yarn dev
```

> Note: Create new enviroment using example.env and update **`__PRISMA_ENDPOINT__`** if you don't have prisma endpoint run `prisma deploy` and use Demo Server to get prisma endpoint

## Documentation

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on http://localhost:4000
* `yarn debug` starts GraphQL server in debug mode on http://localhost:4000
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground for the `projects` from [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml)
* `yarn dev` starts GraphQL server on http://localhost:4000 _and_ opens GraphQL Playground
* `prisma <subcommand>` gives access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `prisma deploy`)

> **Note**: We recommend that you're using `yarn dev` during development as it will give you access to the GraphQL API or your server (defined by the [application schema](./src/schema.graphql)) as well as to the Prisma API directly (defined by the [Prisma database schema](./src/generated/prisma.graphql)). If you're starting the server with `yarn start`, you'll only be able to access the API of the application schema.
